    "### Building a 3D quadrotor model\n",
    "In this second notebook, we'll build a full 3-dimensional quadrotor model! In this one I will be leaving you guys alone a lot more, but as discussed in the lectures, there is a lot of overlap with the 2D model we made last week, so feel free to copy your implementation from there and simply expand it here!\n",
    "\n",
    "**When implementing things like this, I recommend working in steps!** For example, in your 2D model, you may find it's much better to _first_ model the accelerations; see whether that works and only _then_ move on to the angular acceleration. If you do both at the same time, finding bugs (and everyone introduces bugs once in a while!) is much harder. **Keep testing as you write code!**\n",

    "#### Recommended steps\n",
    "- Copy your 2D quadrotor model\n",
    "- Work your way down the same way we did on the 3D model\n",
    "    - Implement the mixing matrix (i.e. compute u1 and u2 from the rotor rates)\n",
    "    - Modify the `state_derivative` functions to take a vector for u2 rather than a float (because now of course that's 3 numbers!)\n",
    "    - Modify the `accel` formulation in your model to 3D (see equations in slides)\n",
